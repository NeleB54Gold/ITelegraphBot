### How to setup and use NeleBot X Framework

You can easily set up a NeleBot X with its docs [here](https://neleb54gold.github.io/NeleBotX/).

| Resource     | Required | Description |
| :----------: | :------: | :----------:|
| Translations | Yes      | _You need to configure the Languages.php file to get the translations on the bot._ |
| Database     | Yes      | _You need to use it to save all accounts, you can use it to collect users, groups and channels to broadcast to and be able to manage them._ |
| Redis        | Optional | _You can use it to store temporary data such as results data, translations and antiflood._ |

For the translations you can use the translations.json file, you can use redis for more speed, and if you want you can set up the OneSkyApp API to update automatically the translations!
